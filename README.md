# Arduino-Robot

## Basic Arduino robot I made in school robotics club

You will need a Arduino uno:

(The diagram for the cables is not done yet, I will make it when the robot's code is completely debugged and tested and I can study the robot's wiring.)

# Take note

The code is not 100% finished and tested so it there may be some bugs, because of school holidays, I cannot test the robot as it is lives at school. Sorry for any inconvenience.
