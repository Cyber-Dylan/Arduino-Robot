# Arduino-Robot

## Basic Arduino robot I made in a robotics club.

You will need a Arduino uno:

You will also need a copy of the [Arduino IDE.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

Plug the requred pins into the reqiered ports and add some wheels and send the code to the UNO, it is reccomended that you plug a power bank into the uno as it wont travel far if it is plugged into your computer.

## This code works in either C or C++, (C++ seemed to work in my experience)
